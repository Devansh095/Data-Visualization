Road Accident Analysis and Prediction

Overview:
This project is focused on analyzing road accident data to identify patterns, predict accident severity, and recommend safety improvements. The dataset contains detailed information on road crashes that occurred in Victoria, Australia from 2012 to 2023. Each record includes data on the accident number, date, time, type, and descriptive codes, as well as additional details such as day of the week, light conditions, road geometry, severity, speed zone, and road management authority.

By leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning models, and Feature Engineering, this project aims to extract valuable insights and develop predictive models that can help improve road safety and inform policy decisions.



1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
Accident Trends Over Time.

Analyze how the number of accidents changes over the years, months, or even time of day.

Identify seasonal trends or patterns in accident occurrences.

Severity Analysis.

Investigate which types of accidents or conditions lead to more severe accidents.

Examine how different factors such as light conditions and road types correlate with accident severity.

Geographical Analysis.

Determine if certain intersections or road types are more prone to accidents.

Visualize accident hotspots to understand high-risk areas.

Impact of Light Conditions.

Examine how different light conditions (e.g., day, night) affect the occurrence and severity of accidents.

Identify any patterns where specific light conditions contribute to higher accident rates.

Speed Zone Analysis.

Explore how different speed zones impact the type and severity of accidents.

Analyze the correlation between speed limits and accident outcomes.



3. Machine Learning Models
   
Classification Models:

- Severity Prediction: Build a model to predict the severity of an accident based on features such as accident type, light conditions, speed zone, etc.
- Accident Type Prediction: Predict the type of accident (collision, vehicle overturn, etc.) using features like time, road geometry, light conditions, etc.

Clustering Models:

- Accident Hotspot Identification: Use clustering techniques like K-Means to identify accident hotspots based on location data.

Time Series Analysis:

- Accident Forecasting: Forecast future accident occurrences using time series data, allowing for better resource allocation and preventive measures.

Anomaly Detection:

- Outlier Identification: Detect unusual patterns or outliers in accident data that might require further investigation.

  

3. Feature Engineering
   
Time-Based Features:

- Day/Night Indicator: Create a binary feature indicating whether the accident occurred during the day or night.
- Weekend Indicator: Add a feature to distinguish accidents occurring on weekends versus weekdays.
- Time of Day Categories: Convert the accident time into categories (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening, night).

Interaction Features:

- Light Condition and Road Geometry: Combine these features to see if certain road types under specific lighting conditions are more dangerous.
- Speed Zone and Accident Type: Interaction between speed zones and accident types could reveal higher-risk combinations.
  
Derived Severity Levels:

- Binary Classification for Severity: Simplify severity into a binary outcome (e.g., minor vs. major) for certain models.
  
Geographical Features:

- Proximity to Intersection: Create a feature to measure how close an accident is to an intersection.
- Urban vs. Rural Indicator: Determine if an accident occurred in an urban or rural setting based on node ID or road type.



4. Potential Use Cases
   
Traffic Safety Policy Recommendations:

- By analyzing patterns and predicting risks, you can help shape policies for traffic safety improvements.
  
Resource Allocation:

- Predicting where and when accidents are most likely to occur can aid in the allocation of resources like traffic patrols and emergency services.
  
Driver Assistance Systems:

- Insights from the analysis can be used to enhance driver assistance systems in vehicles, potentially warning drivers about high-risk conditions.
